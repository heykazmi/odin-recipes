      <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the fried rice: Heat oil in a pan and sauté onion until softened. Add vegetables and cook until crisp-tender. Stir in cooked rice, chicken/ham (if using), ketchup, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, ensuring everything is heated through.</li>
        <li>
            Cook the omelette: In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and milk. Heat butter in a pan over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and tilt the pan to spread it evenly. Let the bottom set slightly before gently pushing cooked edges towards the center. Repeat until the omelette is almost cooked through but still slightly runny.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the Omurice: Place a mound of fried rice in the center of the omelette. Carefully fold the sides over the rice, creating a half-moon shape. Use a spatula to gently transfer the Omurice to a plate.
        </li>
