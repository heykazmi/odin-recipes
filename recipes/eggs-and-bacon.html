      <h3><strong>Tips:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adjust the amount of chili pepper to your spice preference. Go easy,
          go bold, the choice is yours!
        </li>
        <li>
          Want a richer flavor? Swap the sesame oil for bacon fat. Remember,
          with great flavor comes great responsibility (calories).
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't be afraid to get veggie-powered! Add bell peppers, mushrooms, or
          any other heroes to the Ghibli Garden Frittata.
        </li>
        <li>
          Master the culinary blade! Shape the Demon Slayer Scramble into stars
          or slayer swords with your trusty spatula. Impress your fellow slayers
          with your skills!
